# RAG-WikiGPT

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the modern age of information, the ability to efficiently retrieve and generate relevant content is crucial. This project focuses on implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines document retrieval and natural language generation to provide precise and contextually relevant answers to user queries. Leveraging pre-trained models from Hugging Face and a FAISS index for fast document retrieval, this project aims to enhance the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly in scenarios requiring large-scale information retrieval and generation.

## Introduction

As the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, the challenge of accessing and synthesizing relevant information becomes more complex. Traditional search methods often fall short in providing the nuanced and contextually appropriate answers that modern applications demand. The RAG model bridges this gap by combining the strengths of retrieval-based systems and generative models. In this project, we integrate state-of-the-art models, including the GPT-2 for text generation and DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) for document retrieval, to create a system capable of understanding and responding to user queries with high accuracy. By incorporating FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the project also ensures that document retrieval is not only accurate but also efficient, even when dealing with large datasets.

## OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a RAG system that can retrieve relevant documents from a large dataset and generate contextually accurate responses to user queries. The system aims to:

- Leverage Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models for effective document retrieval.
- Utilize GPT-2 for generating detailed and contextually relevant answers.
- Implement a FAISS index to ensure rapid retrieval of documents even in large datasets.
- Compare the system’s performance against traditional question-answering models to highlight the improvements brought by the RAG approach.

## BENEFITS

The RAG system offers significant benefits, particularly in fields where quick access to relevant information is critical. By combining retrieval with generation, the system provides:

- **Improved Accuracy**: The system can retrieve and generate answers that are more accurate and contextually appropriate compared to traditional search methods.
- **Efficiency**: FAISS indexing allows for fast retrieval, making the system scalable and efficient, even with large datasets.
- **Versatility**: The system’s ability to integrate various models and handle different types of queries makes it highly versatile across different applications, from customer support to research assistance.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: By providing precise and relevant answers, the system enhances the overall user experience, making interactions more intuitive and productive.

## Data Source

The project utilizes a subset of the Wikipedia dataset, consisting of a diverse range of articles covering various topics. This dataset was chosen for its comprehensiveness and relevance to real-world information retrieval tasks. The dataset was processed and indexed using FAISS to facilitate rapid document retrieval during the query-answering process.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
The dataset used in this project comprises a substantial collection of Wikipedia articles. These articles were processed and indexed to form the basis of the retrieval system.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved tokenizing the articles and preparing them for the retrieval and generation models. The FAISS index was built during this stage to enable efficient retrieval of documents.

### Model Implementation
- **DPR Models**: Implemented for document retrieval. Both question and context encoders were utilized to encode queries and documents, respectively.
- **GPT-2 Model**: Used for generating answers based on the retrieved documents. The model was fine-tuned to improve its ability to generate contextually relevant text.
- **FAISS Index**: Integrated to facilitate fast and efficient document retrieval from the dataset.

### Model Evaluation
The system was evaluated based on its accuracy in retrieving relevant documents and the quality of the generated answers. Key metrics included retrieval accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for generated text.

## Results

The RAG system demonstrated significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and the quality of generated answers compared to traditional question-answering models. The use of FAISS indexing allowed the system to scale effectively, handling large datasets with minimal impact on performance. Overall, the system achieved a high level of accuracy and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.
